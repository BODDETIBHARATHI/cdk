Lab 1 - installation + connection
  1. set path
     -> set ora (check installation directory for oracle db)
  2. sqlplus
     ->if path -> sqlclient is installed 
  3. Task Manager
     services -> check orac* services
  
  TO connect
    sqlplus '/ as sysdba'
    give installation password here
    on sql prompt 
      CREATE USER scott1 IDENTIFIED BY tiger1;
      GRANT CONNECT TO scott1;
      GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE, DBA TO scott1;
      exit
    on cmd prompt
      sqlplus 
        login - scott1
        password - tiger1
      create table dept (deptno varchar(2) );
       select * from dept;

Lab 2 - connection
    connect to remote oracle installation (SQLClient / TOAD)
        sqlplus admin/MyPassword@//mydb.cyhhds8qhsga.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:1521/mydb
        sqlplus admin/MyPass@//mydb.cyhhds8qhsga.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:1521/ORCL

sqlplus 'admin@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=mydb.cyhhds8qhsga.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(ORCL)'
